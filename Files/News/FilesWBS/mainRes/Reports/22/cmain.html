        MIERLO, THE NETHERLANDS -  GNT, a supplier of plant-based Exberry colors, said "Regeneration Rising" is becoming a popular trend among the food and beverage industries.

"Regeneration Rising" consists of three color directions of "Elevated Earth," "Nature Lab," and "Wholesome Nostalgia."

"Elevated Earth" features earthy shades, including red-browns, warm oranges, textured purples and inky teals. These colors may help elevate products with an organic but premium look and feel, according to the company.

"Nature Lab" encompasses a range of colors from green, pink, red, yellow, orange and blue.

"Wholesome Nostalgia" welcomes such colors as yellow, green, blue, peach and pink that offer a velvet-like to milky, translucent, muted and dreamlike appeal, the company said.

"Consumers of all ages are developing a much stronger interest in sustainability and rebuilding their relationships with the natural world," said Dieuwertje Raaijmakers, marketing communications specialist at GNT Group. "To appeal to these shoppers, food and beverage companies have to showcase their commitment to the planet. Color can play an important role in telling that story, helping brands create appealing products that send out strong visual signals about how they're produced."
