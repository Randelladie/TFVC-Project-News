        MANILA, Philippines — Senator Robinhood Padilla on Thursday took a swipe at police officers who allegedly communicated with International Criminal Court (ICC) investigators about the role they played in the bloody war on drugs waged by former president Rodrigo Duterte.

“Pwede naman sila tumangi. Bakit kayo magpapasailalim dyan e pulis kayo dito sa Pilipinas?,” said Padilla in a Kapihan sa Senado forum.

(They could’ve refused. Why would you subject yourself to them when you’re a police officer in the Philippines?)
Former Senator Antonio Trillanes IV earlier disclosed that ICC investigators contacted more than 50 former and active police officers who served under the Duterte administration.

“Based on highly credible information, the ICC investigators have already directly communicated with more than 50 active and former PNP officials regarding their being implicated in the crimes against humanity case of Rodrigo Duterte at the ICC,” Trillanes said.

According to the former senator, this means that if these officers do not “immediately signify their intention to cooperate with the investigators, their status would be elevated to being suspects.”

Padilla, on the other hand, maintained that President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos had already stated that the Philippine government would not lift a finger to help the ICC probe.

“Matigas ang ulo nitong ICC na ito, eh hindi ko naman sila masisi kung pinipilit nila yan. Pero malinaw naman ang guidance ng ating mahal na Pangulo na hindi tayo mag cooperate dyan sa ICC,” said Padilla.

(This ICC is stubborn, but I can’t blame them if they are pushing for that. But it is clear under the guidance of the President that we will not cooperate with the ICC.)
