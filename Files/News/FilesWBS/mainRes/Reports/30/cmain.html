        San Beda University shrugged off a third set hiccup to overcome San Sebastian College-Recoletos, 25-17, 25-19, 22-25, 25-18, in the NCAA Season 99 men's volleyball tournament on Sunday at the FilOil EcoOil Centre.

The Red Spikers remained unscathed with a 3-0 card while inflicting the Stags their first taste of defeat to fall to 2-1.

Rookie Van Book continued his stellar outing with an all-around showing of 21 points anchored on 15 attacks, four blocks, and two aces while also making his presence felt on defense with six receptions. 

The 20-year-old outside hitter unloaded back-to-back blocks to give San Beda a 24-17 lead before Ralph Cabalsa punched the game-winning point to deny the Stags from forcing a decider. 

Anrie Bakil chipped in 19 points built on 14 attacks while Ralph Cabalsa and Alener Munsing chipped in 12 and 11 markers apiece. 

Sophomore Kyle Villamor led San Sebastian with 15 points together with three digs and 11 receptions while Joshua Espenida chimed in with 13.
