        KANSAS CITY — Pet Food Processing magazine and parent company Sosland Publishing Company announce the speaker lineup for the inaugural Pet Food Processing Exchange, an educational and networking event to be held Oct. 7 to 8 in Kansas City, at the InterContinental on the Country Club Plaza. The goal of the inaugural event is to unite industry influencers, thought leaders and decision makers.

Attendees will include pet food and treat manufacturers as well as professionals involved in animal nutrition, ingredient development, food science, product development, food safety, processing and packaging technologies.

“The inaugural Pet Food Processing Exchange will offer attendees the chance to expand their knowledge about the formulation, production and safety of pet food through topical presentations given by leaders in the industry,” said Dave Crost, publisher of Pet Food Processing. “Our team has put together an agenda covering topics ranging from ingredient formulation, supply chain challenges, exporting opportunities, recall protection, sustainable packaging and so much more.

“You also won’t want to miss the perspectives and insights that will be shared by our State of the Industry panel and during the Plant of the Future session,” Crost added.

Speakers presenting during the 1 ½-day event represent pet food processing organizations, industry associations and supplier companies. Other subject matter experts from the fields of animal nutrition, data analysis, supply chain logistics, legal, design and automation will share their knowledge on-stage.
