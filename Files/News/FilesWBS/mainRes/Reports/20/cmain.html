        KANSAS CITY - Restaurant-inspired flavors are sweeping through the condiment aisle, as more food manufacturers are updating sauce portfolios.

Companies like Primal Kitchen are bringing restaurant-inspired flavors into their portfolios. The brand recently expanded with four condiments, including a Chicken Dippin' sauce, a Special sauce, a Yum Yum sauce, and an avocado lime sauce.

"Dipping sauces have quickly become a pantry staple for consumers, with one in four US households now purchasing the subcategory," said Audrey Burger, head of commercial strategy, insights and planning at Primal Kitchen. "However, the current options at shelf rely heavily on seed oils, like soybean or canola, refined sugars and artificial ingredients. Our new dipping sauces bring you all the flavor of restaurant favorites, with the high-quality ingredients you've grown to expect from Primal Kitchen."

The Kraft Heinz Co. also is throwing its hat into the restaurant-inspired ring with its latest launch from the newly formed Kraft Sauces portfolio.

"We know that 30% of our consumers are already purchasing Kraft sauces in multiple categories," said Alan Kleinerman, vice president of global disruptive innovation at Kraft Heinz. "By uniting our sauces, spreads and salad dressings under one masterbrand, we're transforming Kraft Sauces to create a toolkit of flavorful enhancers that consumers can use however they like and drive greater value."

To mark the rebrand and first logo chancge in 10 years, Kraft Sauces debuted a Creamy Sauces line, which features offerings like garlic aioli, chipotle aioli, burger aioli, smoky hickory bacon-flavored aioli and Buffalo-style mayonnaise dressing.

"Our insights show 77% of consumers are eager to explore new aioli flavors, so we saw an opportunity to give our consumers what they're looking for while also strengthening our position as a leader in sauce innovation," Kleinerman said.

San Diego-based Chosen Foods debuted its own take on restaurant sauces with the introduction of the "Dip & Drizzle" line. The line includes three sauces, a chicken sauce, which features a mustardy kick and a sweet finish; a burger sauce, which is a blend of tangy, mustardy and oniony flavors; and an everything bagel sauce, which has a creamy and garlic flavor with poppy seeds.
