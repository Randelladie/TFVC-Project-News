        Veterans Mark Barroca and Ian Sangalang sparked off the bench to lead Magnolia's 107-93 mastery over Phoenix in the PBA Philippine Cup on Sunday at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium.

        Barroca tied his career-high after pouring in 27 points alongside four assists, one steal, and one rebound while the seasoned big man followed up his previous outing last game against NorthPort with 23 markers, nine boards, five dimes, and one block. 
        
        The Hotshots have now won back-to-back games to improve to 3-2 while the Fuel Masters dropped to 2-5 just two days after a tight victory against Converge. 
        
        Magnolia pulled away for good in the fourth quarter, extending a two-point lead at the end of the third, 79-77, to an 18-point cushion late in the game following a three-pointer from Barroca, 105-87. 
        
        Prior to that, the Hotshots had to overcome a double-digit deficit early in the second half after RJ Jazul buried a triple to give Phoenix a 60-49 advantage.
