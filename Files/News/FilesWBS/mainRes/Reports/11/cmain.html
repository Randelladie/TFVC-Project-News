        MANILA CITY, Philippines - Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla has ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate the recent circulation of deep fake audio recording of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. purportedly instructing the military to act against China.

Remulla's order came after the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) said that the manipulated audio was made using artificial intelligence (AI).

The audio clip was uploaded in a popular streaming platform and eventually gained traction across various social media channels.

"I am instructing [the NBI] to file the necessary legal action, if warranted, against those behind this fake news," Remulla said in a statement Thursday.

"Hold accountable the personalities behind this deceiving act, and make the investigation swift and comprehensive to ascertain the truth," he said.
