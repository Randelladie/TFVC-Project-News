    <h5>Hans Leo Cacdac, OIC, Department of Migrant Workers    </h5>
    <p>
        MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Thursday named Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) Officer-in-Charge Usec. Hans Leo Cacdac as the new Migrant Workers Secretary.

“President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has appointed Department of Migrant Workers Undersecretary Hans Leo Cacdac to head the department, a year after he was designated as the officer-in-charge on April 8, 2023,” said the Palace in a statement.

According to Marcos’ letter of appointment to Cacdac dated April 25, the decision was made pursuant to Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, which enumerated the powers of the Executive Branch.

“You are hereby appointed ad interim Secretary, Department of Migrant Workers,” said Marcos.

“By virtue thereof, you may qualify and perform the duties of the office, furnishing the Office of the President and the Civil Service Commission with copies of your Oath of Office,” he added.

Prior to Cacdac, Susan Ople headed the DMW until her death due to breast cancer in August 2023.  

Cacdac’s official appointment as DMW Secretary comes seven months after being named as the agency’s OIC in September 2023.

Before his appointment, Cacdac was a former Executive Director V of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, Executive Director V of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration , and Undersecretary at the Department of Labor and Employment.
