        NEW YORK - MOM Group brand GoGo squeeZ has unveiled a new shelf-stable fruit snack made for active teenagers and young adults.

        Packaged within a convenient, squeezable pouch format, GoGo squeeZ Active Fruit Blend contains electrolytes, antioxidants and vitamins C, A and E. The snack is designed specifically to help recover potassium, sodium and magnesium expended during physical activity, and each serving contains 60 calories per serving and between 11 to 12 grams of sugar. Flavors at launch include strawberry pineapple orange, cherry raspberry lime and blueberry strawberry lemon.
        
        "We are energized to introduce GoGo squeeZ Active Fruit Blend with electrolytes to active individuals who are on-the-go," said Mark Anthony Edmonson, chief marketing officer for the company.
        
        The product is now available in 18-count quantities at Sam's Club stores for $14.98 and in 10-count quantities for $9.99 at Target locations. GoGo squeeZ expects to add additional retail availability for the 10-count packs beginning in May, including Walmart, Kroger and online through Amazon.
