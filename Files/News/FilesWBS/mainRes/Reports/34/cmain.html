    <h5>Jeremy Pacatiw during the ONE Fight Night 21: Eersel vs. Nicolas. –ONE CHAMPIONSHIP    </h5>
    <p>
        MANILA. Philippines—After being sidelined for 16 months, Filipino fighter Jeremy Pacatiw returned in a triumphant way to announce his comeback in ONE Championship.

        Pacatiw made quick and easy work of China’s Wang Shuo, winning via first round submission in ONE Fight Night 21: Eersel vs. Nicolas at Lumpinee Boxing Stadium on Saturday.
        
        Pacatiw made a leap to the bantamweight division with his victory as he improved to a 13-5 record.

        Pacatiw was expected to pull out a slow-paced opening round with this being his first match in a long while.
        
        But instead of getting his feet wet, the Lions Nation MMA combatant immediately jumped his Chinese foe with punches and strikes that seemed to have caught Wang by surprise.
        
        Wang, though, wasn’t any slack as he matched Pacatiw’s energy in the striking department but the fight immediately took a turn when it hit the mat.
        
        The 27-year-old fighter from Benguet took charge and locked Wang to a rear-naked choke which made the latter tap in the 2:07 mark of the opening round.
        
        In the main event, Alexis Nicolas defeated Regian Eersel via unanimous decision to win the ONE Lightweight Kickboxing World Championship.
