        ISLAMABAD -- As Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi wrapped up a trip to Pakistan this week, the two sides agreed to boost trade and work on rebuilding trust in the wake of border clashes in January. But experts say that pressure from Washington will continue to overshadow the relationship, making it tough for Islamabad to ramp up business with its neighbor.

Raisi visited the Pakistani capital along with the major cities of Lahore and Karachi from Monday through Wednesday, meeting the nation's president and prime minister as well as the chief ministers of Punjab and Sindh provinces.

It marked the first visit by any head of state to Pakistan since general elections in February and the first trip there by an Iranian president since 2017.

During the tour, the countries agreed to increase the annual value of bilateral trade to $10 billion over the next five years, from $2 billion currently. A statement from the two also referred to setting up joint border markets, economic free zones and working on the long-touted Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline.

Iran completed its section of the pipeline in 2013, but Pakistan has yet to start construction on its segment amid fears of U.S. sanctions. Indeed, experts believe that despite the joint statement, Pakistan is unlikely to move ahead on the pipeline or increase trade volumes with Iran due to American pressure.

Asked about Islamabad's efforts to expand economic engagement with Iran, Vedant Patel, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, told media on Tuesday, "Let me say broadly we advise anyone considering business deals with Iran to be aware of the potential risk of sanctions."

Muhammad Shoaib, an assistant professor of American studies at Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, said that the South Asian country cannot afford to annoy Washington at this time. "Pakistan is pursuing a loan deal with the IMF (International Monetary Fund), which is not possible to get without the consent of the U.S."

However, Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Sanober Institute think tank in Islamabad, said Pakistan would probably try to persuade the U.S. over the issue of the pipeline. "Pakistan will try to convince Americans that cheap gas is necessary for Pakistan to keep inflation down and stop any uprising against the government in case of massive inflation."

The joint statement also touched on border security. "Both sides reiterated the importance of forging regular cooperation and exchange of views between political, military and security officials of the two countries to combat threats such as terrorism, narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, hostage-taking, money laundering and abduction," it read.

Some had hoped for substantial discussions on the issue of cross-border attacks by proxy groups based in the border areas of both countries. But background interviews with multiple officials with knowledge of the visit suggested there were no developments on this topic.

Despite that, experts believe that Pakistan's security institutions want to engage with Iran to curb mistrust between the two sides. "Since Pakistan has a large informal economy, so it will be beneficial to engage more with Iran's informal economy," Cheema said.

Analysts said the primary goal of Raisi's visit was to remove mistrust created after the two countries carried out strikes on each other's territory in January, targeting militants.

"The Iranian government wants to connect with Pakistani society keeping in mind recent Iran-Pakistan tensions," said Cheema.

Shoaib from Quaid-i-Azam University agreed. "This trip was meant to restore the positive public perception of Iran in Pakistan, which was damaged due to the January incident."

Raisi's trip also included visits to the mausoleums of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah and national poet Allama Iqbal. His wife visited an orphanage and addressed students at multiple universities.

Sabookh Syed, a political analyst based in Islamabad, told Nikkei Asia that goodwill toward Iran has increased in Pakistan after it "stood up to Israel" over the conflict in Gaza. "[Raisi] wanted to further solidify the support for Iran among Pakistani people through public engagement," he added.

Cheema of the Sanober Institute said that Raisi "wanted to cash in on anti-Israel sentiment in Pakistan and wanted [to develop] a connection with the masses knowing the government [of Pakistan] is compromised and has to manage its foreign policy by looking at Western and Arab states."
