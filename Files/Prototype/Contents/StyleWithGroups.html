        <h1>A wolf in sheep's clothing</h1>
        <p>
            Once upon a time a <span class="animal">Wolf</span> resolved to disguise his appearance in order to secure food more easily. <br>
            Encased in the skin of a <span class="animal">sheep</span>, he pastured with the flock deceiving the <ins class="shepherd">shepherd</ins> by his costume. <br>
            In the evening he was shut up by the <ins class="shepherd">shepherd</ins> in the fold; the gate was closed, and the entrance made thoroughly secure. <br>
            But the <ins class="shepherd">shepherd</ins>, returning to the fold during the night to obtain meat for the next day, <br>
            mistakenly caught up the <span class="animal">Wolf</span> instead of a sheep, <span id="bad">and killed him instantly.</span>
